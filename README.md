# PSA: Changes are happening

From August 2018 onwards, Linuxserver are in the midst of switching to a new CI platform which will enable us to build and release multiple architectures under a single repo. To this end, existing images for `arm64` and `armhf` builds are being deprecated. They are replaced by a manifest file in each container which automatically pulls the correct image for your architecture. You'll also be able to pull based on a specific architecture tag.

TLDR: Multi-arch support is changing from multiple repos to one repo per container image.

[Duckdns](https://duckdns.org/) is a free service which will point a DNS (sub domains of duckdns.org) to an IP of your choice. The service is completely free, and doesn't require reactivation or forum posts to maintain its existence.

## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures such as `x86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list). 

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| x86-64 | amd64-latest |
| arm64 | arm64v8-latest |
| armhf | arm32v6-latest |

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker

```
docker create \
  --name=duckdns \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -e SUBDOMAINS=subdomain1,subdomain2 \
  -e TOKEN=token \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  linuxserver/duckdns
```

### optional parameters
`-e LOG_FILE=true` if you prefer the duckdns log to be written to a file instead of the docker log  
`-v <path to data>:/config` used in conjunction with logging to file

### docker-compose

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```
---
version: "2"
services:
  duckdns:
    image: linuxserver/duckdns
    container_name: duckdns
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - SUBDOMAINS=subdomain1,subdomain2
      - TOKEN=token
    mem_limit: 4096m
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London |
| `-e SUBDOMAINS=subdomain1,subdomain2` | multiple subdomains allowed, comma separated, no spaces |
| `-e TOKEN=token` | DuckDNS token |


&nbsp;
## Application Setup

- Go to the [duckdns website](https://duckdns.org/), register your subdomain(s) and retrieve your token
- Create a container with your subdomain(s) and token
- It will update your IP with the DuckDNS service every 5 minutes



## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it duckdns /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f duckdns`
* container version number 
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' duckdns`
* image version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' linuxserver/duckdns`
